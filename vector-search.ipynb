    "## Introduction to Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern applications like recommendation systems, chatbots, and search engines need to handle **unstructured data** such as text, images, audio, and video.  \n",
    "Traditional search (keyword or SQL-based) struggles here, which is why **Vector Search** is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Vector?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **vector** is simply a list of numbers (like `[0.2, -0.4, 1.7, ...]`).  \n",
    "- In machine learning, vectors are used to represent **features** of data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- A sentence can be converted into a vector that captures its meaning (using embeddings like Word2Vec, BERT, etc.).\n",
    "- An image can be converted into a vector that represents its visual features.\n",
    "\n",
    "These vectors usually live in **high-dimensional space** (e.g., 128D, 512D, 1024D).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Vector Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vector Search** is a technique to find the most similar items to a given query based on their vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of looking for exact matches (`WHERE name = 'Alice'`),  \n",
    "  vector search finds items that are **closest in meaning or similarity**.\n",
    "- It uses **mathematical distance** (cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, etc.) to compare vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "If you search for *\"puppy\"*, results may include *\"dog\"*, *\"cute pet\"*, *\"golden retriever\"*—because their vectors are close in meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Vector Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional search:\n",
    "- Works well for structured data and exact keywords.\n",
    "- Struggles with synonyms, context, or unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector search:\n",
    "- Handles **semantic similarity**.\n",
    "- Works with **text, images, and other unstructured formats**.\n",
    "- Powers modern systems like:\n",
    "  - Google Search (*related queries*)\n",
    "  - ChatGPT knowledge retrieval\n",
    "  - Netflix & Spotify recommendations\n",
    "  - Image similarity search\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Vector Search Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Encoding (Embeddings)**  \n",
    "   Convert text, image, or audio into numerical vectors using a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vector Database**  \n",
    "   Store all vectors in a specialized database (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate, FAISS).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Similarity Search**  \n",
    "   Convert the query into a vector and compare it with stored vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return Results**  \n",
    "   Retrieve items whose vectors are most similar to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarity Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cosine Similarity** → angle between vectors.  \n",
    "- **Euclidean Distance** → straight-line distance.  \n",
    "- **Dot Product** → magnitude & alignment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example (Text Search)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sentence          | Vector (simplified) |\n",
    "|-------------------|----------------------|\n",
    "| \"I love cats\"     | [0.2, 0.8, 0.5]     |\n",
    "| \"Dogs are cute\"   | [0.3, 0.7, 0.6]     |\n",
    "| \"Pizza is tasty\"  | [0.9, 0.1, 0.2]     |\n",
    "\n",
    "If query = \"I like kittens\" → vector ≈ [0.25, 0.75, 0.55]  \n",
    "Closest matches = **\"I love cats\"** and **\"Dogs are cute\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tools for Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector Databases**: Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate  \n",
    "- **Libraries**: FAISS (Facebook AI), Annoy, ScaNN  \n",
    "- **Cloud Services**: Elasticsearch (with vector search), OpenSearch, Vespa  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector Search = similarity search in high-dimensional space.**\n",
    "- It’s essential for handling **unstructured data** (text, images, audio).  \n",
    "- Core idea: **represent data as vectors → compare similarity → return nearest neighbors.**\n"
